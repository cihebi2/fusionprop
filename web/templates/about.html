    <h1 class="mb-4">About Us</h1>
    <p class="lead mb-5">This page provides information about the research group and institution behind the FusionProp tool.</p>

    <h2 class="mb-3">Our Lab / Group</h2>
    <p>FusionProp was developed within the research group led by <strong>Professor Yun Tang</strong> at the <strong>School of Pharmacy, East China University of Science and Technology (ECUST)</strong>, located in Shanghai, China.</p>
    <p>Our group is affiliated with the <strong>Shanghai Key Laboratory of New Drug Design</strong> and the <strong>Shanghai Frontiers Science Center of Optogenetic Techniques for Cell Metabolism</strong>.</p>
    <p>
        Our research integrates computational and theoretical approaches to address fundamental questions in biology and drug discovery. We focus on developing and applying cutting-edge methods in <strong>computational biology, bioinformatics, artificial intelligence (AI) for drug design, and protein engineering</strong>. Specific areas of interest include leveraging deep learning models (like protein language models) for predicting protein properties and functions, structure-based and ligand-based drug design, molecular simulations, and systems biology approaches. We strive to develop efficient computational tools, like FusionProp, to accelerate the discovery and development of novel therapeutics and biotechnological solutions.
